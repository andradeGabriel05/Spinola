# Hello, World!

This is a college project. I've to make a website about something that make me fell good, briefly speaking. 

# How to use

First of all, create the database; the script is in "spinola.sql". Then, change the config to your system credentials (database password, user etc.)

I acctualy made a mess with npm and yarn. So use "yarn" and "npm i" to install dependencies. 
Inside Spinola folder in shell, use "yarn dev" to start the front-end (react). "npm start" to start backend (node express) inside "spinola-system-ap√≠" in shell.

I hope you like! I did this!
