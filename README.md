# Hello, World!

This is a college project. I've to make a website about something that make me fell good, briefly speaking. 

# How to use

First of all, create the database; the script is in "spinola.sql". Then, change the config to your system credentials (database password, user etc.)

I acctualy made a mess with npm and yarn. So use "yarn" and "npm i" to install dependencies (both folders).
Inside Spinola folder in shell, use "yarn dev" to start the front-end (react). "npm start" to start backend (node express) inside "spinola-system-ap√≠" in shell.

# Videos

I'm not winning any money with that project. I used some videos of Busuu and Memrise. I don't want get sued. So, if Busuu or Memrise have any problem with that, please, contact me and i'll remove the videos. I just used those videos to make my college of the semester. 

I hope you like! I did this!
